Alright, so you need an APK Editor, preferably [this one](https://discord.com/channels/1087797698771566644/1092823432330231848/1120371270589091870)


Now, go to the folder where the GDPS is stored, most likely Downloads.


Click the GDPS apk, click Common Edit, copy both the name and package name.


Go to the menu apk, click Common Edit, delete the name and package name, and replace it with the one you copied.


### Click save, **but DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT install it yet.**


Instead, go back to the gdps apk.
Click simple edit, go to "lib > armeabi-v7a", save the libcocos2d.cpp file to a folder.


Go to the apk editor directory, click the mod menu with the changed name, click simple edit, again, go back to the folder, and replace the libcocos2d.cpp file there, with the one from earlier.
